## Refresh Rate

[the beautiful world of refresh rates](https://www.coolblue.be/en/advice/monitor-refresh-rate.html)

A Refresh rate is the number of times per second that an image is displayed by the monitor. The refresh rates are measured by hertz (cycles per second.) Some common refresh rates include 60HZ, 120HZ, 144HZ, and 240HZ. We will be going over the uses, pros, and cons of different refresh rates down below. 

**60HZ:**

## Contrast Ratio

The contrast ratio is defined as the ratio of the luminance (a photometric measure of the intensity per unit of light traveling in a given direction) of the brightest shade of white to the darkest shade of black that the system can produce. Contrast ratio is measured in candelas per square meter (cd/m^2) The higher the contrast ratio, the better. There are three common contrast ratios, 1000:1, 4000:1, and 10000:1 

![Contrast Ratio Visual Chart](https://github.com/ebrandwein21/1600-final/assets/150644846/1b8835eb-0fc5-4882-b86d-24bdf0dfe077)

## Brightness

Brightness is the amount of light that the display generates. Different displays produce different levels of brightness. This affects the monitors’ ability to be seen in a brightly lit room, in sunlight, or fluorescence. Brighter displays produce better results in brightly lit settings. Brightness is measured in nits (nt), also known as candela per meter squared (cd/m^2). Some common brightness levels seen in displays are 250 cd/m2, 350 cd/m2, and 500 cd/m2. 

[Brightness Text Guide](https://www.unilumin.com/blog/nits-brightness.html#:~:text=One%20handy%20device%20for%20the,an%20estimate%20of%203.14159%20lux.)

## Color Space and Gamut
![color space chart](https://github.com/ebrandwein21/1600-final/assets/150644846/3f87c00b-1d7b-4e6a-8850-d1ab5e91160b)

Color space is the type of color and number of colors that originate from combinations of color components of a color model. It is the specific organization of colors. Gamut, however, is a certain complete subset of colors that is accurately represented within a given color space or output device. Some popular color space applications and versions are SRGB, Adobe RGB, ProPhoto RGB, and CIE 1931 XxY

 **SRGB:**
  - Common Uses- standard color space for cameras, computers, and applications
  - Advantages- structured mathematically, accessible to consumers, and supported by popular displays. Therefore, suitable for casual hobbies, and online content
  - Disadvantages- limited gamut makes SRGB not ideal for professional photo, animation, and video editing

 **Adobe RGB:**
  - Common uses- professional photography and printing a large range of colors
  - Advantages- structured mathematically like SRGB but has twice the color gamut, compatible with sRGB
  - Disadvantages- most standard consumer displays and applications are catered towards sRGB and not Adobe RGB products 

 **ProPhoto RGB:**
  - Common uses- Used in professional photography and printing applications
  - Advantages- RGB with the widest range of colors, the largest gamut, and very high quality.
  - Disadvantages- Not very accessible in the consumer sphere across applications and devices. Therefore, doesn’t transfer over to consumer devices, leaving the image                                oversaturated on these standard devices.

 **CIE 1931 xyY:**
  - Common uses: scientific research on color
  - Advantages: most precise gamuts that scientists have made, essential in industries requiring accurate color matching and needing a vast color variety
  - Disadvantages: not designed for consumer consumption, limited consumer options, does not translate across more standard color spaces like sGRB and Adobe RGB

## Gamma

- **1.0, 1.8, 2.2:**
  - Different gamma values for adjusting image display characteristics

## Viewing Angle
In display technology, viewing angle Links to an external site. Viewing Angle is the maximum angle at which a display can be viewed with stellar visual performance. The color of the image or its brightness changes as the viewer moves the angle at which they view the monitor. Great monitors have large viewing angles. This means that the quality of the image remains consistent, or within an acceptable range of quality, when the angle is large.
![How viewing angles work](https://github.com/ebrandwein21/1600-final/assets/150644846/93b62ea2-9fc2-41c9-add6-2cd8eaf9379d)

**140°:**
 - Common Uses: older monitors and televisions 
 - advantages: cheaper than other display angles, can be efficient in technology like laptops 
 - disadvantages: color and contrast distortions when viewed from sides, not situational for a display where multiple need to view the screen.

 **160°:**
 - Common Uses: media consumption, gaming, and office work from a bit of a distance
 - advantages: offers wider viewing angle compared to 140° which means improved display when viewed from sides
 - disadvantages: Angle isn’t effective enough for color and brightness accuracy for professional use

 **178°:**
- Common Uses: Found in high-end monitors and TVs, expensive professional equipment
- advantages:  top-of-the-line color and brightness from most angles, ideal for collaborative photo editing, graphic design, animation, and game development where multiple people                will be looking at the screen
- disadvantages: May be too expensive and inaccessible for someone just looking for a casual everyday use display. 

## Response Time
Response Time is the amount of time a pixel takes to change. Response time is measured in milliseconds> Therefore, the shorter the response time, the faster and more efficent the visual transitions are.On the other hand, a higher response time means more motion blur and visual artifacts. 


 **5ms Reaction Time:**
- Common Uses: common in low-level monitors for general use and streaming
- advantages: cost-effective and decent for personal, and non-professional use.
- disadvantages: noticeable motion blur, specifically in situations with gaming or streaming content. It is not ideal for hobbies or professions that require the use of fast-                      motion graphics.


 **3ms Reaction Time:**
  - Common Uses: found in most modern computers and monitors
  - advantages: More responsive compared to 5ms, reduces motion blur in fast-moving situations such as videogames and media
  - disadvantages: still may exhibit some motion blur in very fast-paced situations

 **1ms Reaction Time:**
  - Common Uses: common in high-quality monitors and laptops
  - advantages: Perfect for gaming and games where response times are critical such as Counter Strike. Lack of motion blur.
  - disadvantages: Like most of the “high quality” entries in our tutorial, a 1ms reaction time will cost you, and may even cause you to sacrifice a better viewing angle or color                    accuracy

## Abilities and Access Restricting

### Should My Display Have 3D?

The display will either come with shutter glasses or polarized glasses. Some pros of 3D viewing can be the immersive experience and interaction with 3D content such as films and games. However, Compared to a decade ago, less televisions support 3D viewing. There is less and less content that supports the feature. It may not be worth the additional cost unless you have a passion for 3D media.

### Should My Display Have HDR?

High dynamic range video describes video that has a dynamic range greater than that of Standard Dynamic Range Video. Due to this, there is improved brightness and contrast, richer colors and color variety, increased support for HDR content as well as a better immersive experience. However, you will have to weigh if the cost and the lack of complete content availability (for now) are worth these advantages


### Content Protection for Video and Audio

High Bandwidth Digital Content Protection is a form of digital copy protection developed by Intel to prevent copying of audio and video as it travels across devices and their respective connectors. Before being sent across connections, the HDCP encrypts the content so it can't be translated and copied during translation. The content remains protected over the transmission process and HDCP completes its goal of protecting the intellectual property rights and preventing unauthorized duplication and distribution of copyright material

### Parental Control with V-Chip

You can do this by using a V-chip. A V-chip has been technology used in television sets since 1999. It allows parents and guardians to block certain programs based on rating categories by receiving a special code that blocks programs based on their maturity rating.
